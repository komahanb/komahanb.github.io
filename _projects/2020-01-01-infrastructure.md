The primary motivation is to produce robust and reliable aerospace designs aligned with Genichi Taguchi's view. I find that the application of optimization under uncertainty (OUU) methods, in the context of aerospace design-optimization, provides a systematic way to achieve the required stochastic response characteristics in aerospace vehicle designs. I focus my efforts on the development of stochastic simulation infrastructure to provide the key ingredients needed for OUU, namely:

- Access to high-fidelity deterministic and stochastic physics simulations to analyze the effect of design changes on the underlying laws of physical equilibrium.  
- Access to design variable gradients of the quantities of interest that feed into optimization frameworks to calculate further design improvements or changes.  
- Access to mean, variance, and standard deviation of the spatio-temporal quantities and their corresponding design variable gradients through the application of the adjoint method.

For the creation of simulation infrastructure, I apply the philosophical perspective of structuring stochastic calculations around deterministic calculations -- a choice that aids in natural, modular extensions that reuse capabilities implemented in deterministic space-time (DST) when computations are carried out in probabilistic space-time (PST).

Even within the realm of aerospace engineering, I believe optimization under uncertainty represents a truly vast context: 

>  The simplest route to conceive this complexity is to view the subject matter as mathematically segmented domains of space (3-dimensional), time (1-dimensional), probability (N-dimensional), and an overarching engineering design domain (M-dimensional), with interactions among these domains.
