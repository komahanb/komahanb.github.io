High-performance aerospace structures are light-weight, flexible, frequently made from multiple, connected components, and are subject to dynamic loads. To design structures subject to these conditions, we propose a scalable adjoint method for coupled flexible multibody dynamic simulations. Adjoint-based derivative evaluation methods have been used for design optimization in a wide-array of multidisciplinary applications. However, relatively few authors have developed adjoint methods for flexible multibody dynamic simulations. To address this issue, we develop a modular adjoint-based derivative evaluation method for flexible multibody systems that is designed for high-performance parallel computing environments. We envision that this framework will be useful for the assessment and design of flexible multibody systems that arise in many aerospace applications.
