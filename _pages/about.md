In the context of computational sciences in aerospace engineering, I conduct research within the domain spanned by *philosophy* <img src="../files/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *mathematics* <img src="../files/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *physics* <img src="../files/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *computing* :

- The first channel of my work relates to the advancement of mathematical analysis pertinent to physics such as the fluid-mechanics and solid-mechanics.
- The second channel of my work entails the hierarchical structuring (i.e. architecture) and implementation of the mathematical models and algorithms in a form amenable for high-performance computing.
- The third channel of my work concerns the application of these computational analysis capabilities in the context of aerospace design, optimization and control.

## Background

The computational physics simulations technology empowers the makers of aerospace systems to analyze how their design prototypes would perform beforehand, by doing repeated high-volume calculations -- distributed for efficiency -- across a larger network of inter-connected computer-hardware platforms, powered by electrical energy.
Such computational simulations are a viable cost-effective alternative to the more-expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments commonly performed with a limited set of design parameters.
These simulations backed by the mathematical fabric of differential and algebraic equations, provide the ability to predict the performance of design prototypes on a much larger set of design parameters, and foster design innovations or quicker design turnarounds. To leverage this technology for scientific and engineering applications

- the U.S. Department of Energy owns four of the top ten fastest supercomputers in the world [[1]](https://www.energy.gov/science/high-performance-computing), capable of high-volume number crunching of upto 1 quintillion operations per second
- the NASA is pursuing its 2030 vision for computatational methods aiming to improve the state-of-the-art of accuracy, speed, scalability and design optimization capabilities, in additional to the basic computational physics [[Mavriplis 2014]](../files/publications/nasa-cfd-2030.pdf).

The core methods forming the computational mathematics layer are fairly generic to other fields of engineering and computational sciences (e.g. computational biology, computational finance); thanks to [R. Descartes' (1596â€“1650)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) admirable philosophical insights into the abstract nature of mathematics.
